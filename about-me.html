    Hi! My name is Jenn, and I am currently in my third year at Northeastern University as a Computer Science and Media Art
    combined major within the College of Computer and Information Science. As of Fall 2018, I am looking for a six month co-op
    starting in January of 2019. I am open to anything from back-end to front-end, design work, or a mixture of all of it. I love
    service learning so any chance or opportunity I get to help my community and do work for social impact is definitely a plus.
