				Hola! my name is Jenn, and I am currently in my fourth year at Northeastern University as a Computer
				Science and
				Media Art
				combined major within the Khoury College of Computer Sciences. As of Fall 2019, I am looking for co-op
				or
				internship
				opportunities
				starting in January of 2020. I am open to anything from back-end to front-end, design work, or a mixture
				of all
				of
				it. I love
				service learning so any chance or opportunity I get to help my community and do work for social impact
				is
				definitely
				a plus. I am
				definitely looking to move outside of the Greater Boston area (across the country or abroad :^))
				<p></p>
				I am an avid traveler, even if it means spending a straight 31 hours on planes, trains, and hard airport
				benches
				(because that's what it takes to get to <a title="half of where i'm from"
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar">Burma</a>). I'm a big fan
				of bread and love to bake (against my doctor's advice). If I had more time and I could choose more
				careers, I'd
				also
				want to
				try wood joinery and furniture, but right now the resources and opportunities point to media/digital
				content.
