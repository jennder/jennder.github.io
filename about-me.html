    My name is Jenn, and I am currently in my third year at Northeastern University as a Computer Science and Media Art
    combined major within the College of Computer and Information Science. As of Fall 2018, I am looking for a six month (or more) co-op
    starting in January of 2019. I am open to anything from back-end to front-end, design work, or a mixture of all of it. I love
	service learning so any chance or opportunity I get to help my community and do work for social impact is definitely a plus.
	<p></p>
	I am an avid traveler, even if it means spending a straight 31 hours on planes, trains, and hard airport benches 
	(because that's what it takes to get to <a title="half of where i'm from" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar">Burma</a>. I'm a big fan
	of bread and love to bake even though I am intolerant to gluten. If I had more time and I could choose more careers, I'd also want to
	try wood joinery and furniture, but right now the resources and opportunities point to media/digital content.
